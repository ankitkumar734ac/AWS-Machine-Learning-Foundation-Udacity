Machine learning, or ML, is a modern software development technique that enables computers to solve problems by using examples of real-world data.

In supervised learning, every training sample from the dataset has a corresponding label or output value associated with it. As a result, the algorithm learns to predict labels or output values.

In reinforcement learning, the algorithm figures out which actions to take in a situation to maximize a reward (in the form of a number) on the way to reaching a specific goal.

In unsupervised learning, there are no labels for the training data. A machine learning algorithm tries to learn the underlying patterns or distributions that govern the data.

# Components of Machine Learning

Nearly all tasks solved with machine learning involve three primary components:
 + A machine learning model
 + A model training algorithm
 + A model inference algorithm
# What are machine learning models?
A machine learning model, like a piece of clay, can be molded into many different forms and serve many different purposes. A more technical definition would be that a machine learning model is a block of code or framework that can be modified to solve different but related problems based on the data provided.

### Important
     A model is an extremely generic program(or block of code), 
     made specific by the data used to train it. 
     It is used to solve different problems.
# Model
A model is an extremely generic program, made specific by the data used to train it.

# Model training algorithms
Model training algorithms work through an interactive process where the current model iteration is analyzed to determine what changes can be made to get closer to the goal. Those changes are made and the iteration continues until the model is evaluated to meet the goals.

# Model inference
Model inference is when the trained model is used to generate predictions.
